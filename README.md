HTML and CSS: practicing to infinity and beyond

In this project I built a website using HTML and CSS;
I identified elements and styles through Figma;
I applied my knowledge acquired so far in a real project;
I created a repository to store the project code and I deployed the site through Github Pages/Vercel.
